# My Python Project

A brief description of my Python project. This project likely involves data processing, scripting, or Jupyter notebooks based on the files present.

## Setup

To set up the development environment, including creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies, run the `setup_venv.sh` script:

```bash
./setup_venv.sh
```

This will create a virtual environment in the `.venv` directory and install all packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

Once the virtual environment is set up, you can activate it using:

### On Linux/macOS (and Git Bash on Windows):
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### On Windows Command Prompt:
```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### On Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

## Usage

Describe how to run your main scripts or Jupyter notebooks here.

For example, to run `main.py`:
```bash
# After activating the virtual environment
python main.py
```

To open Jupyter notebooks (`start.ipynb`, `start nag.ipynb`):
```bash
# After activating the virtual environment
jupyter notebook
```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main Python script.
- `data.json`: Example data file.
- `nag.json`: Another data file.
- `start.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook.
- `start nag.ipynb`: Another Jupyter Notebook.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `setup_venv.sh`: Script to set up the virtual environment and install dependencies.
